ðŸš¨ **Exciting news for farmers & grid users!**

<br/>

One of the requests weâ€™ve had from farmers and grid users was to have a simpler user experience.

<br/>

**The admin portal (aka TF Chain UI) is a response to that feedback, a graphical user interface, and the starting point for anyone to begin working with the TF Grid!**

<br>

Weâ€™ve tested this portal with people of all technical levels, and the response has been quite good! We believe the portal is a huge step forward for anyone using or managing the ThreeFold Grid.
