ðŸ“£ **ThreeFold @ Consensus 2022**

<br/>

In one month from now, the ThreeFold team will be heading to Austin, TX for Consensus 2022 by CoinDesk, where ThreeFold will be a sponsor!

<br/>

Consensus is the Festival for the Decentralized World â€“ and a decentralized world needs a decentralized Internet â€“ so we are super excited to share ThreeFold with this audience of 15,000+ people.

<br/>

*We'll have more to share, including details on a ThreeFold gathering. For now, if you're interested in heading to Austin, please take advantage of [our discount code](https://events.coindesk.com/consensus2022?promo=a7MsHxui).*
