We’re in talks with an already-live, large-scale "conscious community" project to create their own independent grid of capacity!
<br/>
<br/>
Each home and business property would have its own node or nodes, and capacity would be used for a community-specific platform to improve communication, participation, and ease of life for residents – all in a fully private, secure, & efficient way.
<br/>
<br/>
We're still in the early stages but we’re thrilled to have met this team and to be working towards a partnership that can be an incredible model for many other communities around the world. We will share more as we are able to!
