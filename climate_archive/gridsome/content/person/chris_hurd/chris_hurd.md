bio: Having graduated from the University of Cambridge, I spent most of my career to date in wholesale banking with the HSBC Group. This gave me priceless experience and geographic exposure with my last 3 jobs being at MD level in London, Singapore and Moscow respectively. My responsibilities for managing and leading teams of people in the customer front line helped to fine tune my values which centre around doing the right thing by people and for myself. Since moving on from banking I have been fortunate in being able to acquire new skills and to reinvent, but always with the same values as an underpin. Time is very precious and should be well spent with a sense of humour an absolute essential.
excerpt:  Compared to many, I have been lucky in life, but remain keen not to let it rest there and to continue developing and helping others to do so.
