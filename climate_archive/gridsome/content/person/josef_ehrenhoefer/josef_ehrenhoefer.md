bio: For more than 40 years I have been working in the international IT industry - starting as an engineer at Philips Data Systems, leading service and support organizations in different European countries at Digital Equipment and Compaq Computers and for many years I have been vice president of HPE and DXC Technology Services in Central and Eastern Europe where I had the opportunity to implement large scale Digital Transformation projects in many industries and to lead remote and virtual project teams in a global setting. Since  2018 I'm an independent business consultant with focus on Digital Transformation running my own consulting firm consult2win e.U. - as part of this new independence I'm also spending much time to support innovative digital start-up companies like Threefold, ELOOP, nWoW and Cloudomation to name a few. Innovation, customer benefits, integrity, team-work and a fair and equal treatment of all are core values which inspire and motivate me to achieve great things. Creating a truly decentralized internet, giving back data ownership to individuals and enabling access to data and education for all will for sure help to make our world a bit better. I will be very happy if my little contributions will help to leave a better world to my grand children.
excerpt: After more than 40 years in corporate IT business I'm enjoying now the freedom to run my own consulting business and to help start-ups in different areas of digital innovation.
