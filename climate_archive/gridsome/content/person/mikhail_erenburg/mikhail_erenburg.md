bio: Mikhail Erenburg, 38, is the former Senior Vice President at Sberbank, Eastern Europe's largest bank. Prior to this he was Chief Executive Officer of Asteros, one of top 3 IT system integrators in Russia; COO of Rusal, the worlds largest Aluminum company. Mikhail holds Phd degree from Moscow Aviation Institute and graduated executive programs from Columbia business school and Massachusetts Institute of technology. Ambassador fell in love with Threefold There is no doubt anymore, that the world wants digital currency. At the same time, existing solutions, although highly popular already, lack critical attributes to become truly sustainable long term. I know Kristof good enough to be sure that ThreeFold token can become the next Big Thing.
