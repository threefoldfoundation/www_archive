bio: Franz Josef Allmayer is a universal citizen with roots between Austria and Guatemala. These contrasting yet complementary perspectives allowed him to question existing cultural paradigms built on scarcity from an early age. Dedication to the fields of innovation and global development has enabled Franz to gather transdisciplinary experience working with international organizations, governments, the private sector, NGOs, and academia. This process allowed him to recognize pervading patterns and embrace a whole-systems approach to development that effectively provides value towards the entirety of the system. In recognition of the need to unite fragmented efforts towards a cocreative development process that effectively addresses the challenges of today, motivates Franz to create the tools, processes, and on the ground collaborations to support the development of regenerative bioregional economies. An avid explorer he has visited 77 countries, where he has formed a solid network of collaborators. In his free time, you will encounter Franz finding inspiration in nature, climbing volcanoes, and exchanging with leaders across multiple disciplines.
