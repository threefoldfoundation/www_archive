bio: Humanist & motivated entrepreneur, passionate to help make the world a better place. Kristof strongly believes there is need for a neutral internet owned by millions. We dream about a world where everyone can be happy, with respect for each other and the world’s resources. A world where we dare to love ourselves and we don’t have to be scared about our future. A world where we don’t need to be a product and we have learned to collaborate with openness and trust. <BR> More info on <a href="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/kristof">library.threefold.me</a>
