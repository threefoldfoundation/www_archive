bio: I believe that the majority of people are conscious & kind, and if we join sync we can have an impact on a planetary scale with the help of ‘modern magic’ engineering. I did my PhD degree in financial mathematics at Perm State University (Russia). Being disappointed with the unsustainable and inefficient financial systems we have founded Lykke, Swiss FinTech startup, which has pioneered many cryptofinance solutions like first security token offering, first natural capital-backed token, first non-custodial DEX on Bitcoin blockchain. This journey empowered us to start Vlinder, which aims to radically simplify impact investing and scale citizens actions to solve Earth’s global problems like deforestation, inequality, pollution.
