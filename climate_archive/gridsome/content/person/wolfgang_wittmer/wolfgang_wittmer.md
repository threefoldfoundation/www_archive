He has a strong track record of making things happen through execution and has completed some of the largest Merger and Spin-of projects in the IT sector.

This amazing TFF project is addressing todayâ€™s challenges of complexity, costs and energy usage.TFF will be at the heart of empowering the internet, generating new mind blowing efficiency and economy.
