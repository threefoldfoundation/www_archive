bio: I believe in healthy living, individually and collectively. Risk management is a common good, and my mission is to help spark a global risk culture with ecosystems perspectives. We live in an era of interdependence. The global systems that sustain us -- financial, economic, and ecological -- are fragile. We face tipping points that will affect many generations to come. To thrive, we must move beyond binary thinking and learn to sense a full spectrum of risk, hidden and visible. As in healthcare, our best hope of mitigating systemic risk lies in early detection and action. And we need to do this together.
