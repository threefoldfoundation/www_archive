bio: Simin’s career spans over 23 years in the in the finance sector, working closely with institutional investors in Turkey and globally, specializing on the capital markets business, trading and exchanges. She has taken place in several primary and secondary offerings and placements, organized roadshows and investor conferences and events, and have built, led and supervised sales and research teams at executive positions during her career. Most recently, she has been the CEO of Erste Securities in İstanbul. She is inspired by form and harmony, and finds great outlet in sculpting and designing metal artifacts. For me, the internet is a platform of freedom that facilitates global citizenship, a new stateless economy, possibility of connecting and sharing of all human knowledge and equal opportunities for education. Living in an emerging geography all my life, I experience the significance of this digital freedom every single day, yet I also clearly observe that, its inherent value can only truly prevail through a democratic and borderless distribution of internet access. I believe, ThreeFold’s technology is the latest and much needed link in this digital evolution, presenting a key to unlocking the potential of a neutral, diverse, fair, internet access for individuals and for creating innovative and smart solutions for its business partners globally. That is why I am a proud supporter of Threefold on this meaningful initiative of bringing about positive change to people’s lives via frontier technology and firmly believe in our ability to do so.
