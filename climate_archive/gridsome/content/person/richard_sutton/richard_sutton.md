bio: Richard runs a Brand Development Agency specialising in hi-tech manufacturing, Industry 4.0 and Clean/Future Technologies. He has 30+ years’ experience in large scale project and team management and has broad creative experience in events, media, marketing and strategy. Although with a major automotive background, he is committed to lifestyle right-action, holistic intelligence in business and the circular economy imperative. I am thrilled by everything ThreeFold Foundation stands for and promises to be. The bright-eyed skills and gravitas of its creators and executors; the neatness and purity of its vision and form; its sustainability and neutrality; and its foundational mission to contribute. ThreeFold Foundation is a trail-blazing example of a higher state of consciousness in business. It’s a shaft of light in a tortured, still descending world and a manifestation of something genius.
