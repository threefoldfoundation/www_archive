bio: Kanwal Sibal, with 41 years of experience in diplomacy, is a former Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. He has served as Ambassador to Turkey, Egypt, France and Russia. He was a member of India's National Security Advisory Board from 2008 to 2010. He is on the Board of the New York based East-West Institute.

He was made a Grand Officier of the Ordre National du Merite by the French President. In 2017 he received the Padam Shree award from the President of India. Ambassador fell in love with Threefold The use of the internet will explode in the years ahead as more and more people across the globe connect to it as countries lagging behind in internet usage catch up with the rest. Energy use will grow commensurately and hence the need for “green” solutions which, I believe, the model proposed by the ThreeFold foundation will promote through highly efficient energy storage, distributed computing, anti-hacking safeguards, and protecting our rights to privacy through blockchain, and all this through an innovative financial structure.
