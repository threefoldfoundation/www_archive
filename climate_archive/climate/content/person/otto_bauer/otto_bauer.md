bio: My professional career began in 1981 in customer service for computer systems. After that, I had the opportunity to gain experience in project management, then moved to the area of marketing and product management for Eastern Europe. After building up a product marketing organisation in Eastern Europe, I was given the responsibility of sales management for the memory products division in this region in 1995. In the course of an acquisition in 2002, I was entrusted with the development of the network technology division for the Middle East, Mediterranean countries, Africa and East-Central Europe as Business Unit Manager with a strong focus establishing an indirect sales channel. Following this assignment I took over the role of a European alliance manager combining forces with a leading telco provider for the SME sector in 2009. In the course of a 2-year stay in Prague, I was involved in the development of an inside sales centre for data centre solutions in the region of East-Central Europe, Germany and Austria. Having worked for a multinational technology company, I have 35+ years of experience in the ICT market ranging from Support, Project Management, Marketing, Sales and Business Unit Management. The greatest gift was the privilege to work with multicultural teams in several regional management functions. Change was the only constant, not only in technology but also in the political and economic environment especially in the emerging markets which I served.
excerpt: Nowadays I am proud to pass on some of my experience as lecturer at an educational college.

"Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it; Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it” – This quote from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe has accompanied me throughout my life.
