bio: I am a Social and Business Entrepreneur that initiated and managed various international business enterprises. I initiated Shareitt to enable people and communities to fulfill their talents and potentials. I started my activities as an ‘Artist of Life’ at the age of five when I secretly went to the children zoo and got the rabbits and the pigeons out of their cages and set them free. This motive shines throughout my whole life as an activist that strives for freedom through social and economic reforms. I developed innovative educational programs for adolescents with learning and behavioral difficulties and I had been an accomplished artist that many of my paintings are held in private and institutional collections worldwide. I have exhibited extensively in galleries and cultural centers in Europe, and Israel. I was founding director of the flourishing Waldorf Teacher Training in the David Yellin Academic College of Education in Jerusalem for over 25 years.
