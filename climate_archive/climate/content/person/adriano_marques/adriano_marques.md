bio: Adriano has a 20-year career in which he held multiple roles in the Telecom/IT industry. He took part in IT projects across Brazil and Belgium, ranging from the start up of mobile service providers and business transformations. He helps customers get the best out of Enterprise Software solutions and navigate the trenches of emerging technologies such IoT and 5G. Tech-geek at heart, Adriano is an enthusiast of Blockchain technologies and sees it as an instrument that could help shape our world into a more decentralized society. When not working or thinking about technology, you will find Adriano enjoying time with his family or maybe rocking with his band on stage. I’m delighted to join ThreeFold as an ambassador and help share with the world our vision of how a neutral, scalable and accessible internet can also foster a more sustainable future. Edge computing will play a key role in a range of emerging applications, so there is enormous value to be created for consumers and businesses. I’m impressed by the team’s vision and their ability to put together the intricate pieces of this technology.
