bio: I worked 35 years for HP/HPE as sales/product manager/EMEA Director for Business Critical Server Business, last 10 years as EMEA Mission Critical Server Presales Manager, where I managed an EMEA team of presales specialists who nursed new technologies entering the market as well as managed mature technologies that faced declining business. I retired end of 2017, still eagerly following new technologies as I am an engineer with a Mechanical Engineering diploma from TU Graz, Austria. I am married, have 2 adult daughters, love computers and DIY repairs of any kind, my motorbike and Pilates and engage myself in charity clubs (Round Table, Club 41) since over 30 years.
excerpt: I am a “technology affine” person and always interested in new technologies and advances in IT technology, which I follow closely and try new solutions myself wherever possible.

## Why ThreeFold?

I learned about ThreeFold from Owen Kemp in 2018 and was fascinated immediately by the TF approach. I like the idea to build a digitally responsible internet as well as taking social responsibility to bring affordable compute resources to the world, available to everyone with full ownership of your own data. I followed grid and blockchain technologies from the early days and I am happy to support TF as an active Ambassador since January 2019. I am fascinated about the incredible progress  TF has made since I joined: solutions you can touch, experience and test yourself, not slideware.
