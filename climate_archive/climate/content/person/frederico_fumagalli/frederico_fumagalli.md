bio: Federico,46, holds a Bachelor in Economy and an Executive Management certificate at SDA Bocconi. After having spent 10+ in IT, Federico served for several years a multinational company active in machines industry where heâ€™s been engaged in different executive management positions. Actually, Federico is COO of an innovative Swiss Biomedical company and actively engaged in other innovative and edge-technology initiatives. Ambassador fell in love with Threefold I firmly believe that TFF fills at the best the huge mid-long term gap between availability and demand for one of the key resources; IT capacity. I share the vision of granting whoever and wherever a fair priced, nature friendly and close-by internet capacity. TFF is backed not only with assets but with the right core human values.
