How can I not believe as I know the heart of ThreeFold is pure love . The core of the people , the vision ... ThreeFold is not a revolutionary but rather evolutionary movement that needs to flood the world with love and light . This needs to happen as we all seek growth as a collective consciousness. ThreeFold for me is a heart based foundation which comes from love and is built from love for love , peace and equality.
