bio: Lieven Gevaert inspired my parents for my name-giving. He was the industrialist who brought a lot of prosperity to the region where I live (Antwerp, Belgium). But I wasn't a seventh son. Lieve was just a slight change to start a row of three girls. I am an economist by education. In 1999 I started a recruitment business for IT and business consultants, the internet god introduced in the business world. I got excited about its opportunities to make markets and life better. But there was a fork in the road. If you believe that creativity and entrepreneurial freedom are conditions for a prosperous society, you needed to avoid Big Tech and join forces to build better. Since 2007 I started to connect myself to commonalities to create an appropriate internet and sustainable prosperity. Happy to see so many good evolutions. I believe prosperity for all is possible.
