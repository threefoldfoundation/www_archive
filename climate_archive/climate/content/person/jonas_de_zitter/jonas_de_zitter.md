## Why ThreeFold?

Threefold cought my attention many years ago as a high potential decentralised network solution. From the moment I started following , more and more parts of the puzzle came together, resulting in a new type of internet with features we could't even imagine. It has a great community and combines knowledge and experience from all over the world.
