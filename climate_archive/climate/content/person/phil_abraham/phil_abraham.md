bio: Phil is a true visionary working to create great products for big problems! Recent innovative developments include a collaboration between CloudFace and several technology firms, healthcare suppliers, group purchasing organizations (gpo's), cutting edge rfid and geo-fence firms and strategically linking large healthcare systems in each region of the United States to improve on the internet of things. Phil is supported by a long list of accomplishments ranging from creating one of the world's top supply chain management systems â€“ Manugistics - to having the once in a life-time opportunity to be hand selected by Mr. Harry Pearce, Vice Chair of General Motors (retired). That assignment led to the creation of a cloud solution that would migrate the entire Global General Motors organization to the Cloud. This led to the creation of Covisint which has gone public.
