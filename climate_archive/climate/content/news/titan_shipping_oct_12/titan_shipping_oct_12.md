Hi all 👋

<br/>

We're pleased to share that last week, we began shipping Titan v2.1s ordered by September 10 to the European Union*. Many new farmers have already received their 3Nodes! 👩‍🌾

<br/>

But many of you still haven't filled out the information needed to set up your farm(s). Please note we won't send your 3Node(s) out until we get this information.

<br/>

If you ordered a Titan v2.1 and haven't done so, **[please fill out this short form](https://forms.gle/p8947F8kytTpcJKW6)** so we can get you your 3Node without unnecessary delays.

<br/>

**All other locations will begin shipping in November. Thank you for your patience during this global hardware shortage. 🙏*
