The peer-to-peer ThreeFold Cloud can already support:
<br/>
<br/>

- ✅ Classic IT Workloads
- ✅ Blockchain As A Service
- ✅ Internet of Things or 5G Workloads
- ✅ High Security IT Workloads (e.g. Banking)
- ✅ “Beyond Blockchain” (e.g. Secure Archive)

<br/>
<br/>
The Marketplace provides ready-made solutions that are available for communities seeking alternatives to centralized services.
<br/>
<br/>
And later this year, any DApp developer will be able to run their JavaScript app on the ThreeFold Grid as well!
<br/>
