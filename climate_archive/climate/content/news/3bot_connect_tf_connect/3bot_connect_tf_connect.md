Quick update!
<br/>
<br/>

As mentioned as [a preview in our October update](https://library.threefold.me/info/tfgrid/#/threefold_update_oct2020?id=_3bot-connect-app-updates-coming-in-november), 3Bot Connect is now more accurately named ThreeFold Connect across devices.
<br/>
<br/>
Note: No action is required, although if you have ThreeFold Connect installed already, you may have to update the app before the name changes on your device.
