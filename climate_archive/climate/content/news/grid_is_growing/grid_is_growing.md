This month, we had new nodes come online in Brazil, Cyprus, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Romania, the United States, Italy, Bulgaria, and more. Welcome to our new farmers!
<br/>
<br/>

If you're a farmer or if you're interested in farming and have some questions, please join our farmers chat [here](https://t.me/threefoldfarmers).

And you can always explore live grid stats – total capacity, locations, and much more – [via our grid explorer](https://explorer.threefold.io/)
