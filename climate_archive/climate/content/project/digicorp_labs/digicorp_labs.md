## About

DigiCorp sees how digital lives are becoming more significant, and we’re acting now – bringing this opportunity for freedom and security to life for the people who need it most. Our three elements – DigiThree, DigiLife and DigiWare & DigiAcademy – allow us to focus on the diverse needs of enterprises, consumers and developers, bringing bespoke solutions designed to protect and elevate each audience into the digital future.

## DigiCorp Labs and ThreeFold

DigiCorp and ThreeFold have partnered to form [DigiThree Labs](https://digithreelabs.com). DigiThree is part of the DigiCorp family – an ecosystem of secure, decentralized, metaverse-based services designed to build an inherently secure, people-centric, value creation-focused web of tomorrow.

<br/>

Under the partnership, DigiThree will offer a suite of cloud-based solutions, built to help businesses accelerate seamless digital transformation, implement highly-secure processes and use the vast benefits of blockchain to secure and improve their processes. DigiThree will leverage DigiByte blockchain-secured authentication solutions like Secure ID and Passwordless Login as well as logging capabilities to provide enterprises practical applications of blockchain on top of ThreeFold’s advanced decentralized cloud, offering real-world business requirements such as private and secure video conferencing, file management and storage services, and web browsing.
